Please write a program which will take in a word from a user and search for that word in the word.txt file.

target = input("Enter a word: ")

with open("word.txt", "r") as textfile:
	lines = textfile.readlines()
	is_found = False
	for word in lines:
		if word.strip() == target:
			is_found = True
	if is_found == True:
		print(target)
	else:
		print("Not Found")
    
    
Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each character, from file letters.txt.
Example:
If the following string is given as input from file letters.txt to the program:
abcdefgabc
Then, the output of the program should be:
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1
Hints:
Use dict to store key/value pairs.
Use dict.get() method to lookup a key with default value.


with open("letters.txt", "r") as textfile:
	letters = textfile.readline()
	letter_dict = {}
	for letter in letters:
		if letter in letter_dict:
			letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict[letter] + 1
		else:
			letter_dict[letter] = 1
	for key in letter_dict.keys():
		print(key, letter_dict[key])
