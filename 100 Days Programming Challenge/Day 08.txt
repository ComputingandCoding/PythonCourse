Q1# Boolean: Python finds out the truth
print(5 > 3) # True
print(5 <= 2) # False
print('a' in "face") # True
print('b' in "pants") # False
print("pants" == "face") # False
print(2 == 4/2.0) # True
print("\n")


Q2# 4. What will be the results of...
hands = 2
handy_person = hands > 2
print(handy_person)
print("\n")
#a) True
#b) False
#c) Error
# B --> False b/c 2 is not greater than 2

Q3 # Flow Control: Programs have to be guided through 
# multiple steps. They do this by checking what's true 
# at every step.
today = "Sunday"
if today == "Saturday":
	print ("Pizza")
else:
	print("No Pizza")
print("\n")

Q4 # I/O: Talking to people:
name = input("What's your name?")
print("Hello " + name)

Q5 # 5. Why doesn't this code work?
# age = input("How old are you?")
# print(age + 7)
# We get a "TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"
# to fix this we can do...
age = input("How old are you?")
newAge = int(age) + 7
print("{}".format(newAge))
print(str(newAge))
# We needed to turn age into an int to add it to 7 and then
# convert it back to a string to print it out
print("\n")
