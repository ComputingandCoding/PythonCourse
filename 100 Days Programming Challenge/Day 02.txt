A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. 
If all All 3 sides are same length then triangle is an equilateral triangle 
If Two sides are equal then the trigangle is an isosceles triangle 
If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.
Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.
Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.

side1 = input("Enter a side: ")
side2 = input("Enter a side: ")
side3 = input("Enter a side: ")

if side1 == side2 and side2 == side3:
	print("Equilateral")
elif side1 == side2 or side2 == side3 or side1 == side3:
	print("Isosceles")
else:
	print("Scalene")
  
=======================================================
Notes:
  
*****Boolean Operators******
Operator   "=="  means    Equal to
Operator  "!="  means   Not equal to
  
******Logical Operators********

and   True if both are true  x and y
or 	True if at least one is true 	x or y
not 	True only if false 	not x

=======================================================
Let's do some more practice

x = 5
y = 8

print("x == y:", x == y)
print("x != y:", x != y)
print("x < y:", x < y)
print("x > y:", x > y)
print("x <= y:", x <= y)
print("x >= y:", x >= y)

please check your output what you get for above lines of code, which one comes True and which ones are False.
try changing the value of x and y and see the resutls again .
