In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. 
If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that 
the entered letter is a vowel. 
If the user enters y then your program should display a 
message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, 
and sometimes y is a consonant. 
Otherwise your program should display a message indicating 
that the letter is a consonant.

letter = input("Enter a letter: ")
if letter == "a" or letter == "e" or letter == "i" or letter == "o" or letter == "u":
	print("VOWEL")
elif letter == "y":
	print("Either vowel or consonant")
else:
	print("CONSONANT")
  
  
A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” 
are all examples of palindromic words. Write a program that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to
determines whether or not it is a palindrome. Display the result, including a meaningful output message.

word = input("Enter a word: ")

palindrome = True
for x in range( len( word ) ):
  opposite = (x+1) * -1
  if word[x] != word[opposite]:
		palindrome = False
print(palindrome)
