Q1 # 8. Processing Grades
# Given a list of grades, grades = [81, 70, 60, 91],
# print the average and the number of grades above 80.
grades = [81, 70, 60, 91]
goodGrade = 80
numberOfGrades = len(grades)
totalOfGrades = 0
numberOfGoodGrades = 0;
for grade in grades: 
	if (grade > goodGrade):
		print("WOW! " + str(grade))
		numberOfGoodGrades = numberOfGoodGrades + 1
	totalOfGrades = totalOfGrades + grade
average = totalOfGrades / numberOfGrades
print("Average: " + str(average))
print("Number of good grades: " + str(numberOfGoodGrades))
print("\n")


Q2 # Dictionaries: Data types that store associations
capitals = {"Ontario":"Toronto", 
"Canada":"Ottawa", 
"Croatia": "Zagreb"}
print(capitals["Ontario"])
print("\n")

# Iterate with for-loop
for place in capitals:
	print(place)

print("\n")

Q3 # 9. Quiz the capitals
# Given the capitals dictionary from before, make a 
# flash card-like quiz, where every location is the 
# question and the capitol is the answer.
for place in capitals:
    answer = input("What is the capitol of " + place + "? ")
    if capitals[place] == answer:
        print("Right answer!")
    else:
        print("Sorry, the answer was " + capitals[place])
