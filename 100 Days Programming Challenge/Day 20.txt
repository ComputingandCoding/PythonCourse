Open a file read-only
Use a for loop to read each line
Count the lines and print out the number of lines


Solution:
f = open('anyfile.txt')
count = 0
for line in f:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)



We can put an if statement in our for loop to only print lines that meet some criteria

Solution:
f = open('anyfile.txt')
for line in f:
    if line.startswith('a'):
        print(line)
        
        
fileName = input('Enter the file name:  ')
fileHandler = open(fileName)
count = 0
for line in fileHandler:
    if line.startswith('a') :
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'line started with a', fileName)
