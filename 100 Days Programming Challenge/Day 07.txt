Q1 If I run the following code, what will be the final value of b?
a = 1
b = a * 5
a = 2
# a) 5
# b) 1
# c) 10
# The answer would be ??

Q2: # Lists: a collection box
groceries = ["apples", "cabbage", "soylent"]
print(groceries[0]) # apples
print(groceries[2]) # soylent
print(groceries[-1]) # soylent --> DOESN'T GIVE ERROR (weird)
print("\n")

Q3: # 3. What is the result of running the code print(groceries[3])?
# a) Error
# b) Soylent
# c) Apples
# Guess: Error bc out of range
#print(groceries[3])
# Reality: IndexError: list index out of range

Let's try some more list methods
# Get length of a list
print(len(groceries))

# Append things to a list
groceries.append("tofu")
print(groceries[3])
print(groceries)

Q4:# Uppercase letters
kittens = "kittens"
print(kittens.upper())
print(kittens) # strings are immutable
print("\n")
