Question1:
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1 and 100 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
values = []
for i in range(1, 100):
    s = str(i)
    if (int(s[0])%2==0) and (int(s[1])%2==0):
        values.append(s)
print ",".join(values)

Question2:
Now extend your program for to find all number b/w 100 and 200

Question3:
Now extend your program for to find all number b/w 1000 and 2000
