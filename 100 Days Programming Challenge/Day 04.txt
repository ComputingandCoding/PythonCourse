Write a program which is divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

for i in range(0,10000):
	if (i%2==0):
		if (i%3==0):
			if (i%4==0):
				if (i%5==0):
					if (i%6==0):
						if (i%7==0):
							if (i%8==0):
								if (i%9==0):
									print(i,"Hurray you found me!!!")
															
			
Another way of doing it

for i in range(0,10000):
	if(i%2==0) and (i%3==0) and (i%4==0) and (i%5==0) and (i%6==0) and (i%7==0) and (i%8==0) and (i%9==):
		print(i,"Hurray you found me!!!")
