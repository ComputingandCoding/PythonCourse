Q1 # 6. A person puts in the amount of cupcakes they want 
# and your program returns the total amount they have to pay. 
# The cupcakes are 1.25$ each and only 5 cupcakes can be 
# made at a time!
user_input = input("Enter the amount of cupcakes you desire: ")
# Convert to int so we can do some computations
amount = int(user_input)
if amount <= 5:
	cost = amount * 1.25
	print("Your order costs", cost)
else:
	print("We can only make 5 cupcakes at a time!")
print("\n")

Q2 # Repeating Actions with Loops
# for-each loop

Q3 # 7. Tweet Validator
# Tweets are these messages you post on the Internet that 
# have to be 140 characters or shorter. How can we make sure that 
# a given string is the appropriate length? Print out the 
# length of the string and whether it is valid or not.
# INPUT:
# "OMG Python!"
# OUTPUT:
# 11
# Valid
maxTweetLength = 140
tweet = "OMG Python!"
count = 0
for char in tweet:
    count = count + 1
# OR WE COULD DO: count = len(tweet) --> 
# to get the length (i.e. number of characters)
print(count)
if count <= maxTweetLength:
    print("Valid")
else:
    print("Invalid")
print("\n")
