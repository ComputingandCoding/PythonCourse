open() -- to open the file for reading

open() creates an object that can be addressed in python code


MODE 	Description
'r' 	read only mode
'w' 	write - overwrites file with same name
'r+' 	read and write mode
'a' 	opens for appending to end of file


filecontent = poem_file.read()

print(filecontent)

.read() loads the content of the file into memory as a string, including formatting such as new line (\n)


reading a file with .read(n) where n = number of characters to read
each time poem_file.read(10) runs, the next 10 characters are read.



.read() returns a string
These strings can be manipulated just like any other string
Boolean tests such as:

    .upper()
    .title()
    string slices, e.g.- cities[3:9]
    etc..

and string methods can be performed such as:

    .isdigit()
    .isalpha()
    etc...



File read as a list with .readlines()

converts the lines of a file into a list of strings

# open address to file
poem1 = open('poem1.txt', 'r')

# readlines and print as a list
poem_lines = poem1.readlines()
poem_lines

# [ ] review and run example
for line in poem_lines:
    print(line)



remove newline characters from lists created using .readlines()

for line in poem_lines:
    poem_lines[count] = line[:-1]
    count += 1

line[:-1] sets the end point at the last character of the string, the result is the '\n' (newline) character is omitted



File .close() method frees resources

file.close() method removes the reference created from file open() function

poem1.close()
